A project that provides the automatic acquisition of temperature, humidity and perceived temperature via Arduino and DHT11 sensor. The interface, created in LabVIEW, allows you to view the progress of the acquisition in real time and allows you to save the data on request both on file and locally. Specifically, a server has been developed, using the Spring Boot framework in Java, through which it is possible to save data on a database and, if required, it is possible to obtain measurements with reference to a certain period of time. Furthermore, it is possible to specify both the acquisition time interval via Arduino and how many samples to save within the database.
